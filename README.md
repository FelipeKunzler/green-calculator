Green Calculator is an android application which quantifies the number of trees needed to be planted in order to equalize the amount of thrown CO2 into the atmosphere,  which is calculated through a number of given inputs. The equation was developed by a partnership between Eccos Recycle and Dr. Carlos Sanquetta from UFPR.
